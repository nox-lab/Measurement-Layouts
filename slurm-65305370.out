Sampling 2 chains, 0 divergences ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:00 / 0:24:58
Sampling 2 chains for 1_000 tune and 500 draw iterations (2_000 + 1_000 draws total) took 1498 seconds.
Chain 0 reached the maximum tree depth. Increase `max_treedepth`, increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
Chain 1 reached the maximum tree depth. Increase `max_treedepth`, increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
We recommend running at least 4 chains for robust computation of convergence diagnostics
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.01 for some parameters. This indicates problems during sampling. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08008 for details
The effective sample size per chain is smaller than 100 for some parameters.  A higher number is needed for reliable rhat and ess computation. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08008 for details
